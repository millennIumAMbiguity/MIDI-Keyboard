data.txt formating

On the first row are the channels and colors. It can look something like this:
`3,3,55,72,44,40` "channel in","channel out","pitch","velocity","pitch","velocity"...
This is used to send output, this often controls the lightning on your midi device.

The actual keys are configured as follows.
For a list of all available keys see `Symbols.txt`
Single key action:

midi_key_down_id
  \/
8323216,0,65 <- key_action   //this would output "a"
	/\
 keymode_indedification

Alternativity, you could type the following for the same result:
8323216, 0, 'a' <- character
8323216, 0, "a" <- string
8323216, a      <- simple character

Spaces between commas are optional. 
If the intended mode is '0', then you can skip writing it as the program will use that mode as standard as long its not a string formation.
String are standards as macro and will assume that mode when the second variable is a string.


Macro actions:

midi_key_down_id
  \/
8323216,1,65,-65,160,66,-66,-160,67,-67,68,-68 <- key_actions   //in this case "aBcd"
        /\
  macro_indedification

A positive ID is key_down and a negative is key_up.

Alternatively, you can use a string format to more easily achieve this:
8323216,1,"abc" //types abc


Single key action with 'F24' as addon key (useful when using this program together with AutoHotkey):

midi_key_down_id
  \/
8323216,2,66 <- key_action   //in this case 'b'
	/\
 keyAddon_indedification
