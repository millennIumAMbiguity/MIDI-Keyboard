# MIDI_Keybord


you can start by running `keyBordL\bin\Debug\keyBordL.exe` and chose `3. viewer` by typing "3".
you then have to input your MIDI id. start with "0" and go up until the program responds on midi key actions.

now that you have your MIDI id you can map the keys! 
go back to the menu and chose `1. setup`. insert your MIDI id and then press the midi keys that you want to map.
you can exit the setup by pressing any key on your keyboard and then chose mode `2. run`. 
keep in mind that by pressing any key while the program is activated will cause an exit of the prosses.
also, keep in mind that the default key is not only keys as `1,2,3,a,b,c` but keys as Ctrl and Del.

you can manually remap the keys in the `data.txt` file and you find the characters id in `symbolNumbers.txt`
